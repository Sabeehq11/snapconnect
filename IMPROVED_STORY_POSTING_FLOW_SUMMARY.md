# Improved Story Posting Flow - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved
The original story posting flow had several issues:
1. **Direct posting without choice**: Stories were posted immediately without destination selection
2. **No AI caption suggestions**: Users couldn't get AI-powered captions for their stories
3. **Refresh requirement**: Users had to exit and reopen the app to see posted stories
4. **Poor user feedback**: Only showed "Story posted!" alert with no navigation

## ✅ New Improved Flow

### 📱 Complete User Journey
1. **Take Photo/Select from Gallery** → Camera Screen
2. **Choose Story Destination** → New StoryPublishScreen
3. **Get AI Caption Suggestions** → AI-powered captions based on destination
4. **Publish Story** → Upload and post with proper feedback
5. **Return to Stories** → Automatic refresh and success notification

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. **New StoryPublishScreen** (`src/screens/StoryPublishScreen.js`)
- **Purpose**: Central screen for story destination selection and AI caption suggestions

- Cleaner separation of concerns

### 4. **Enhanced Stories Screen** (`src/screens/StoriesScreen.js`)
