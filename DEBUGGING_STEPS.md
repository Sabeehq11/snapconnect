# 🔧 Image Loading Issue - Step-by-Step Debugging Guide

## 🚨 Current Error Analysis

From your error screen, we can see:
- **Error**: "Image failed to load for message: 7f23d7dc-247d-4e18-84e7-3859ec212a8e Error: [object Object]"
- **Log**: "🏁 Image loading ended for message: 7f23d7dc-247d-4e18-84e7-3859ec212a8e"

This tells us:
1. ✅ The image processing is working (we see the logs)
2. ✅ The URL is being generated
3. ❌ The React Native Image component is failing to load the image
4. ❌ The error details are not being properly shown

## 🔍 Step 1: Check the Enhanced Debug Logs

After the latest changes, you should now see much more detailed logs. Look for:

### Expected Success Logs:
```
🔍 Rendering image message: {message details}
🖼️ Processing image URL for message: [id] URL: [url]
✅ Using existing public URL: [url]
🔍 URL test for message [id] - Status: 200
✅ URL is accessible for message [id]
🔄 Image loading started for message: [id] URL: [url]
✅ Image loaded successfully for message: [id]
```

### Expected Error Logs (if there are issues):
```
❌ Error details: {detailed error info}
❌ Error nativeEvent: {native error details}
❌ Current imageUrl: [url]
❌ Original mediaUrl: [original_url]
❌ Access forbidden - check Supabase storage policies
❌ File not found - check if file exists in storage
```

## 🔍 Step 2: Most Likely Causes

Based on the error pattern, here are the most probable issues:

### 1. **Supabase Storage Policies (Most Likely)**
- **Issue**: The media bucket is not truly public or RLS policies are blocking access
- **Check**: Look for "Status: 403" in the URL test logs
- **Fix**: Run the updated `storage_setup.sql` script

### 2. **Missing Files**
- **Issue**: Files are being uploaded but not actually saved
- **Check**: Look for "Status: 404" in the URL test logs
- **Fix**: Verify upload process is working correctly

### 3. **URL Format Issues**
- **Issue**: The generated URLs are malformed
- **Check**: Look at the "Current imageUrl" in error logs
- **Fix**: The new direct URL builder should handle this

## 🔧 Step 3: Run the Updated Storage Setup

Copy and run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Ensure bucket exists and is public
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('media', 'media', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET public = true;

-- Drop all existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to upload media" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to view media" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to update their own media" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to delete their own media" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public Access" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated upload" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated update" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated delete" ON storage.objects;

-- Create new simplified policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated upload" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'media');

CREATE POLICY "Allow public read" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'media');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated update" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE TO authenticated USING (bucket_id = 'media');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated delete" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE TO authenticated USING (bucket_id = 'media');
```

## 🔍 Step 4: Test the Debug Component

I've created a `ImageDebugger` component. To use it:

1. Import it in any of your screens temporarily:
```javascript
import ImageDebugger from '../components/ImageDebugger';

// Add it to your render method:
<ImageDebugger />
```

2. Run the tests to see what's working and what's not

## 🔍 Step 5: What to Look For

### Test a Snap Exchange:
1. **Send a snap** and check for these logs:
   ```
   🔄 Starting image upload for URI: [local_uri]
   ✅ Upload successful: [data]
   🔗 Generated public URL: [url]
   ✅ Public URL verified as accessible
   ```

2. **Receive the snap** and check for these logs:
   ```
   🔍 Rendering image message: [message_data]
   🖼️ Processing image URL for message: [id] URL: [url]
   🔍 URL test for message [id] - Status: 200
   ✅ URL is accessible for message [id]
   ✅ Image loaded successfully for message: [id]
   ```

### If You See Errors:
- **Status: 403**: Storage policies issue → Run the SQL script above
- **Status: 404**: File not found → Check if files are actually being uploaded
- **Status: 0**: Network/CORS issue → Check your internet connection
- **Malformed URL**: URL generation issue → The new URL builder should fix this

## 🎯 Quick Fix Test

Try this quick test:

1. **Manual URL Test**: Copy one of the generated public URLs from the logs
2. **Paste it in your browser** → Should show the image
3. **If it works in browser but not in app** → React Native Image component issue
4. **If it doesn't work in browser** → Supabase storage policy issue

## 🚀 Expected Resolution

With the enhanced debugging, you should be able to:
1. ✅ See exactly what URL is being generated
2. ✅ See if the URL is accessible via HTTP test
3. ✅ See the exact React Native Image error
4. ✅ Get clear error messages instead of "[object Object]"

The most likely fix will be running the updated SQL script to fix the storage policies, but now we'll have the data to confirm exactly what's happening!
