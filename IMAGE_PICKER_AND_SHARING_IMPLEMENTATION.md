## üöÄ Ready to Use

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. Key points:

## üìã Next Steps (Optional)

To fully enable storage functionality:
1. Run `storage_setup.sql` in your Supabase dashboard
2. Test image upload and sharing functionality
3. Verify RLS policies are working correctly

The app will work with local URIs as fallback if storage isn't set up yet, so you can test the functionality immediately.
