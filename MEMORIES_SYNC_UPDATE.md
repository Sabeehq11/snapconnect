# Memories Sync Between Camera and Profile

## âœ… **What I Updated:**

Your saved memories now appear in **BOTH** places:

### 1. **Camera Image Picker â†’ Memories Tab**
- Shows photos you've saved using the bookmark button
- Real-time access to your memories database

### 2. **Profile â†’ Memories Screen** 
- Same memories from the camera also appear here
- Updated to load from real database instead of mock data
- Auto-refreshes when you navigate to the screen

## ðŸ”„ **How It Works:**

```
Camera Photo â†’ Save to Memories â†’ Appears in BOTH:
â”œâ”€â”€ Camera Picker (Memories Tab)
â””â”€â”€ Profile Screen (Memories)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Database Connection:**

Both screens now use the same `memories` table:
- **TabbedImagePicker**: Loads from `memories` table for the "Memories" tab
- **MemoriesScreen**: Loads from `memories` table for the profile memories
- **PhotoPreview**: Saves to `memories` table when you tap bookmark

## âœ¨ **Features Added:**

### TabbedImagePicker (Camera)
- Real memories from database
- Displays photos you've saved through the app

### MemoriesScreen (Profile)  
- Replaced mock data with real memories
- Auto-refresh when screen opens
- Delete functionality (removes from database)
- Same photos as the camera picker

## ðŸ“± **User Flow:**

1. **Take a photo** in camera
2. **Tap bookmark** to save to memories
3. **Check camera picker** â†’ See it in "Memories" tab
4. **Go to Profile â†’ Memories** â†’ See the same photo there too
5. **Delete from profile** â†’ Removes from database permanently

## ðŸŽ‰ **Result:**

Your memories are now **perfectly synced** between:
- Camera image picker (Memories tab)
- Profile memories screen

Same data, same photos, same experience everywhere! ðŸ“¸
